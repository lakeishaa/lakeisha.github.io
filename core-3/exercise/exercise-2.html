<!-- 
Default: Static Positioning
- positioned according to the flow of the page 
- cant adjust

Relative Positioning
- can be adjusted

Fixed Positioning
- used for menu bar
- fixed to the screen, despite any scrolling
- fixed to the screen, not going to scroll with you
- it'll stay with you no matter what

Absolute Positioning
- Div within a div 
- like fixed but relative to a parent div and not the screen
- so if u move the div by 5px itll move 5px from the parent div not screen
